# Hi, I'm Muhammad Ambursa

A passionate **DevOps Engineer** with a knack for bridging the gap between development and operations. I thrive on automating chaos, optimizing workflows, and scaling systems that power the future. Currently building resilient infrastructures and CI/CD pipelines that make software delivery feel like magic.

## Projects

**Automated Multi-Cloud Deployment Pipeline**  
Designed a GitHub Actions workflow with Terraform for provisioning and deploying applications across AWS and Azure, including automated rollback on failures.

**Kubernetes Cluster with Observability**  
Built a production-grade K8s cluster using Helm charts, integrated with Prometheus and Grafana for real-time metrics and alerting.

**Infrastructure Monitoring Dashboard**  
Developed a centralized ELK Stack setup with Ansible playbooks to aggregate logs and visualize system health across distributed environments.

**Zero-Trust Security Pipeline**  
Implemented OPA-based policy enforcement in CI/CD pipelines, scanning for vulnerabilities and enforcing compliance in Docker images.
