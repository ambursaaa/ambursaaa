## Projects

**Decentralized NFT Marketplace**  
Built a full-stack dApp on Ethereum using Solidity for smart contracts, React for the frontend, and IPFS for metadata storage. Features include bidding, royalties, and lazy minting.

**DeFi Yield Farming Protocol**  
Developed a yield optimizer on Solana with Rust smart programs, integrated with Raydium for liquidity pools, and a Vue.js dashboard for user staking and rewards tracking.

**Cross-Chain Voting DAO**  
Created a governance dApp using Polkadot's Substrate framework, enabling token holders to vote on proposals across chains with Chainlink oracles for secure data feeds.

**Web3 Identity Wallet**  
Implemented a self-sovereign identity system on Ethereum with ERC-725 standards, using Hardhat for testing and Web3.js for wallet interactions, focusing on privacy and user control.
